1. Feature Scaling is applied to columns, it is never applied to data across rows. It means that the data of the entire column is brought into a range of values using the methods at hand.

2. There are mainly 2 types of feature scaling:
    i. Normalization
    ii. Standardization


*Normalization* 

    Formula :

    X' = (X-Xmin)/(Xmax-Xmin)

    where, 
    X' = new value
    X = value in the column
    Xmin = minimum value in the column
    Xmax = maximum value in the column

    range for the column after we apply normalization is : [0;1]


*Standardization*

    X' = X-u/s

    where, 
    X' = new value
    X = value in the column
    u = mean
    s = standard deviation

    range for the column after we apply normalization is : [-3,+3]
    Note : there might be some outliers that lie outside this range.
