# Machine Learning models implementation
---
- This repo tracks machine learning progress over time, will be implementing various models using **Python** language.

- All datasets are included in the respective folder and there is a ipynb file or link in each implementation.

- Chapter names will be added as per progress and each folder will have its own folder and index.

- Refer the below inde for modules and sub-modules.
