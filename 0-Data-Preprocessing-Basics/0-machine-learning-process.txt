The machine learning process is as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing
    i. Import the data
    ii. Clean the Data
    iii. Split into training and test sets

2. Modelling
    i. Build the model
    ii. Train the model
    iii. Make predictions

3. Evaluation
    i. Calculate performance metrics
    ii. Make a verdict
